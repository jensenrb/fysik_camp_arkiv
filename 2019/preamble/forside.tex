\frontmatter
% The titlingpage environment used in frontstuff resets the page
% numbering to start at 1 at the end. But this means that several
% pages will be known as i, ii, iii (since the \frontmatter sets
% \pagenumbering{roman}). This is not a problem in print, since the
% first few pages don't have folios. But hyperref will complain about
% "destination with the same identifier (name{page.i})". To avoid
% these, we pretend that the first few pages are numbered with
% uppercase roman letters...
\pagenumbering{Roman}
